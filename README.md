# Overview

As a software engineer focused on expanding my web development skills, I built this Currency Converter application to deepen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and modern ES6+ features. My goal was to create a practical, real-world application while mastering key programming concepts like recursion, array manipulation, exception handling, and third-party library integration.

This Currency Converter is a fully-featured web application that allows users to convert between 26 world currencies using predefined exchange rates. The application includes:
- A real-time currency converter with instant updates as you type
- A compound interest calculator demonstrating recursive algorithms
- Interactive bar charts visualizing exchange rates using Chart.js
- A statistics dashboard showcasing ES6 array methods (map, filter, reduce, sort, find, some, every)
- Comprehensive error handling with custom exception classes

My purpose for writing this software was to gain hands-on experience with JavaScript's core features in a practical context. Rather than building isolated code snippets, I wanted to integrate multiple concepts into a cohesive application that demonstrates how these features work together in production-quality code.

# Future Work

- Integrate a live exchange rate API (e.g., Exchange Rates API, Open Exchange Rates) for real-time rates
- Add currency conversion history with local storage persistence
- Implement user preferences saving (default currencies, theme)
- Add line charts showing historical exchange rate trends
- Support cryptocurrency conversions (Bitcoin, Ethereum)
- Add unit tests using Jest testing framework
- Implement offline functionality with service workers
